# Making Interesting JavaScript Projects Daily

I will be creating at least one JavaScript project daily to improve my understanding of JavaScript. All the resources I use will be available in the individual project files in the `resources.txt` file.

## Completed Project List

- [Project 1: Android Style Model](link-to-project-1) - To open the model click on `open model` button and to close the model click on the overlay model text is also scrollable and responsive .

- [Project 1: Dragable-Slider](link-to-project-1) - Made a swiper using swiper js library added auto play loop and other features .

## Other Resources

- [otherResources.txt](link-to-resources-file) - List of resources used for the projects.
